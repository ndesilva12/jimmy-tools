## r/FOIA Post

**Title:** I created a free FOIA Quick-Start Checklist after filing dozens of requests

**Body:**
Hey r/FOIA,

I've been filing FOIA requests for a while now and kept making the same mistakes early on. Finally put together a free 1-page checklist covering:

- Pre-filing research (where to check first)
- The exact phrases that prevent agencies from narrowing your request
- Fee category and waiver basics
- What to do after you submit

Free PDF, no email required: jimmytools.net/free/foia-quick-start-checklist.pdf

If this is useful, I've got a full 50-page guide covering agency-specific strategies, appeal templates, and advanced techniques at jimmytools.net - but the checklist should get most people started.

Happy to answer questions about FOIA in the comments.

## r/OSINT Post

**Title:** Free resources: OSINT techniques I use regularly

**Body:**
Wanted to share some techniques that have been useful for me:

**People Search (Free)**
- TruePeopleSearch, FastPeopleSearch - addresses, relatives, phone numbers
- Namechk - find usernames across platforms
- Have I Been Pwned - check email breach exposure

**Business Research**
- OpenCorporates - company records globally
- State SOS websites - LLC/corp filings
- SEC EDGAR - public company filings

**Image/Location**
- Yandex Images - best facial recognition (seriously, better than Google)
- TinEye - find image origins
- SunCalc - analyze shadows for time/location

**The thing most people miss:** Cross-referencing. One source isn't enough. Match the same info across 3+ sources before considering it verified.

I wrote a full playbook (50+ techniques, 60 pages) at jimmytools.net if anyone wants to go deeper. But the tools above are genuinely free and I use them daily.

What techniques do you find most useful?

## r/Landlord Post

**Title:** DIY tenant background checks - what I actually search

**Body:**
Lot of landlords pay $30-50 per tenant screening service. Here's what those services actually do (and how to do it yourself for free):

1. **Sex offender registry** - nsopw.gov (free, national search)
2. **Criminal records** - Search county court websites for each place they've lived
3. **Eviction records** - Same county court sites, civil cases section
4. **Identity verification** - Cross-reference their ID with free people search sites

The hard part is knowing WHICH county courts to search. You need their address history first - TruePeopleSearch usually shows this.

For landlords who want the full process, I put together a guide covering all record types, state-by-state resources, and checklists: jimmytools.net/products/background-check-diy

But honestly, the steps above catch 90% of what paid services find.

What's your screening process?
