# Twitter Thread: FOIA Secrets

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I've filed dozens of FOIA requests to federal agencies.

Most get ignored or denied.

But a few tricks changed everything. Here's what actually works 🧵

## Tweet 2
First mistake everyone makes:

Sending requests to the wrong place.

FBI ≠ CIA ≠ DHS. Each agency has separate FOIA offices. Some have regional offices too.

Wrong address = months of delays.

## Tweet 3
The magic phrase that stops agencies from playing games:

"All records, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO documents, emails, text messages, and messaging app communications."

Without this, they'll claim your request was "too narrow."

## Tweet 4
Want records for free?

Most people don't know: journalists, researchers, and educators get fee waivers.

But you have to ASK. And you have to explain why disclosure serves the public interest.

## Tweet 5
The "personal devices" trick:

Add this line: "Please search all locations where responsive records may be stored, including personal devices and accounts used for government business."

This is how Hillary's emails got found. Works for any agency.

## Tweet 6
Agencies will claim "no responsive records."

90% of the time, this means they didn't look hard enough.

ALWAYS appeal. Ask them to describe exactly what they searched. You'd be surprised what they "find" on the second look.

## Tweet 7
The 20-day response deadline is a myth.

FBI averages 12-18 months. CIA can take 5 years.

If you need records fast, request "expedited processing" and explain the urgency. Only works if you're media or there's a genuine deadline.

Best-kept secret: check the reading room FIRST.

Most agencies post frequently-requested docs online:
• vault.fbi.gov
• cia.gov/readingroom
• foia.state.gov

Your records might already be public.
